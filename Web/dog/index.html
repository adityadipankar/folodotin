	I am a dog.

	I try to draw.

	But to draw with my paws is difficult. I cannot hold a pencil.

	I cannot hold a pencil, I cannot hold a brush.

	Why do I want to draw?

	I thought I should give you something to look at. I should distract you.

	If I do not distract you, you will go on thinking of the crazy,
	dangerous things you think of.
</span>
	
	Things about changing the world. Things about reform. Things about
	jurisdiction and about recouping your investment.

	<span class='showHide'>
	I am a dog. I just need to be loved.

	I cannot draw. But I have a story to tell.

	What should I do? How do I reach out?

	The only thing you understand is the wagging of my tail and the slurps
	of my saliva.

	Is that my language?

	Shall I constrain myself to this language?

	I tried doing that. You thought I had a thing for the bitch next door.
	You got me a mate.

	Your act has only aggravated my anguish.

	Now I have to deal with a lot. Even though my mate understands my
	language, she refuses to understand it. She asks me to be a good dog.

	But I am bad.

	I will keep wagging my tail till you can grasp the fact that the
	pattern of my wagging is a language. Till you are prepared to
	understand that language.

	When you understand this language, you will get my story.

	What is my story? What story can any dog tell? A story about boredom,
	looking at the world through a window and having nothing new to
	consume.

	Stories can deal with different challenges. The challenge my story
	deals with is getting through an unwillingness on your part to
	interpret my wagging tail.
